Note: There is a folder on the root folder called "Fleetio UI Wireframe" that contains the Affinity Designer file I used to plan my simple UI.
Note: I have added UI feedback to the Edit icon (pencil) on the details page. While this feature is not currently connected to the Fleetio API, it provides a user experience preview. I can update and refine the state logic for this feature as needed.
