*Note: There is a folder on the root folder called "Fleetio UI Wireframe" this folder will have the affinity designer file i used to plan my simple UI
*Note: I have added UI Feedback on the Edit Icon(Pencil) on the details page, this however is not hooked up to the Fleetio API. I just tried to add something that the user can experience. I can update and clean up the state logic for this if needed
